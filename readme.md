# Python  :snake:


Python has become one of the most common programming languages that is used for almost all technologies right now. (2020 ; if anyone from the future is reading this and goes like what is this guy saying).

 
 I have been working with deeplearning and pytorch for a while now, originally being a java developer :coffee: coming to this field I feel I need to be working on learning some basics of python. So here we go.


 ### Before we get started let me state the obvious

 1. Python is case sensitive.
 2. Spacing is importat. (wow that's a first).
