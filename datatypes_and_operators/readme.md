# Datatypes and Operators

Datatypes and Operators are the building foundaitons of any programming language.

## Arithmetic Operators

The basics 

1. "+"
2. "-"
3. "/"
4. "*"
5. "%"
are all the same in python

some different operators are 

1. "**"

which is used for exponential operation

2. "//" 

which is used for Dividing and rounding off numbers to the nearest integer


## Variables

variables are used to assign a value to a name

example

```python
 a = 10
 ```

 lets see a trick up the pythons sleeve

 If we are assigning a very closly related variables for exanple

```python
x = 10
y = 20
z = 30
```

Insted of this we can assign them like this

```python
x,y,z = 10,20,30
```

pretty cool huh

## *something to remember*

1. Only use ordinaly letters, numbers or underscore while naming variables.
2. Never put spaces while naming variables.
3. Never use any Reserved words or Build-In Identifiers while naming variables.
4. If you have a word say my variable name it as my_variable, its the python way of naming variables.
