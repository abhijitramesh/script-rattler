# Object Oriented Programming
If you are starting to code in python and you are looking at this page please go away. Object Oriented Programming is not the way to get started with coding. That being said I think it might work out different with different people. I started coding in java which is an Object Oriented Programming pro language. Things did not go well for me then since I was not able to understand most of the stuff that was happening TBH. Then I learned to code in C and that was when things started making sense. Going back to java now I understand most of the core stuff and I am pretty confident about it. Anyways Python is very simple to grasp so lets see.

# Vocabularies
The basic things to understand in Object Oriented Programing is as the name suggests _Objects_, This is the fundamental building block of OOP. But its better to relate this to real world examples.

Imagine that you are walking into a shop and you find a T shirt. This T shirt is yellow in color, size is XL and has V neck. Then there is another T shirt which is green in color, size is L and the neck is normal. The price of the yellow shirt is say 15$ and the size of the green shirt is say 20$. Since we are confused among the shirts we end up not buying them and go back home and come back the next day with a friend to finally make a decision. So here we are looking at both the shirts and to out surprise the price has changed. The yellow shirt is now 12$ and the green shirt is now 15$. Now let us critically analyze this situation. T shirts are something very generic and it has some properties like color, style, price. And it does some kind of action also like changing its price. 
#### Classes
In OOP was the generic thing that is T shirt is called a class its like a blue print from which more items can be made.
#### Attribute
These are the characteresetis of the T shirt like color,size,price etc...
#### Methods
The shirt does some action like changing its price this is called Method.
#### Object
The specific T shirt that is derived from this blueprint of T shirts with all specified _Attributes_ and does some _Method_ is called an Object Like the Yellow or Green Shirt.
